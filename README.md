I am a CS phd student at Northeastern University. My focus is programming languages. My background is three years of core cs undergrad courses and some grad courses at Iowa State and University of Hawaii, and two plmws, two oplsses, for external learning experience. No research experience.

In this repository, I am modeling PCF (programmable computable functions, Plotkin 1977) with **list** and **def**. Since we modeled PCF at *redex summer school*, I jumped right into writing down the syntax. To add types to my PCF language, I read the redex manual (https://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/tutorial.html). It seemed going well, but my model turned out to be quite buggy.

Here is the list of subtle (or non-subtle, if you are a more experienced language designer) problems my naive language had:

1. **binding-forms** clause must come last in your syntax.

```racket
#:binding-forms             
 (λ (x T) e #:refers-to x)
```
The explanation behind this rule is that the grammars that come after #:binding-forms are considered binding-forms.

2. what is a more general type environment? · or Γ?

```racket
(Γ ·
   (Γ (x T) ...))
```

This is my type environment. My intuition was defining judgment using · (the empty environment) is more general in that you don't need anything!

```racket
[--------------- "T-TRUE"
   (⊢_e · tt Bool)]

  [--------------- "T-FALSE"
   (⊢_e · ff Bool)]

  [------------- "T-NUM"
   (⊢_e · n Num)]
```

So these were my judgments for constants (that do not need further computation). My intuition was wrong (again). Since · is a special form of Γ, Γ includes · and thus more general. Some failed tests succeeded after changing empty to gamma.

```racket
[--------------- "T-TRUE"
   (⊢_e Γ tt Bool)]

  [--------------- "T-FALSE"
   (⊢_e Γ ff Bool)]

  [------------- "T-NUM"
   (⊢_e Γ n Num)]
```

3. T-VAR, misunderstood.

```racket
[
  ----------------------------------------------------- "T-VAR"
  (⊢_e (Γ (x T) ... (x_1 T_1) (x_!_1 T_2) ...) x_1 T_1)]
```

4. More to come ....
